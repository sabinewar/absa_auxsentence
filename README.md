Author: Sabine Warringa
Date: January 26th, 2022

This is the code corresponding to the Natural Language Processing Assignment of the course Intelligent Systems at Universidad Polit√®cnica de Madrid. It consists of a Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb`, a `requirements.txt`, and a written report `report.pdf`. Moreover, data is required which is not uploaded due to copyright issues.

### Instructions on running `notebook.ipynb`
The notebook itself contains all required actions to run the code, like installing `requirements.txt` and importing libraries. It is required to have the provided data in the same directory as the notebook, exactly as provided:

```
directory
|- notebook.ipynb
|- README.md
|- requirements.txt
|- data
|--- SemEval
|------ restaurant_train.xlsx
|------ laptop_train.xlsx
|--- MAMS
|------ train.xlsx

```

Alternatively, the data can be directly downloaded from the sources listed below, opened in Microsoft Excel and saved as a .xlsx file.
